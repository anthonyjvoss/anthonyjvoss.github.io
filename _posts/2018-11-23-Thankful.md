title:  "Giving Thanks..."
---

So very thankful today, and every day.  

One great benefit of focused gratefulness is reflecting on milestones along the way.  
I'm thankful for my wife and the joy and excitement she brings to our life together.
I'm thankful for my sweet son and getting to watch him grow and learn.
I'm thankful for my parents and sister who played a large part in shaping who I am today.
I'm thankful for those in my career who encouraged and pushed me to do and be better.

Let me never take any of these for granted.  Hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving!
